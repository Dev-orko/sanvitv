# Sanviplex

A modern movie streaming front-end built with React + Vite, using TMDB API for movie data. Designed with Tailwind CSS and animated with Framer Motion.

Features
- Browse latest, popular and top-rated movies
- Responsive grid rows with hover animations
- TMDB integration using `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY`

Quick start
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the API keys if needed.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `pnpm install`.
3. Run in dev: `npm run dev`.

Notes
- This is a front-end demo. For production usage you should keep API keys secret and use a server-side proxy.
- The project expects Node.js and a package manager installed.
